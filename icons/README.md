# About Our Icons

We use local copies of the beautiful [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) icons, which are released under an [MIT license](https://github.com/feathericons/feather).
We changed `fill=none` to `fill=white` to work with `mix-blend-mode: exclusion;`.
The license file, `LICENSE`, applies to the SVG files in the present directory.
